 UDP Packet Broadcast and Receive Classes

## Python Runtime Environment Requirements

Python 3.11 or newer.

## Testing the Classes

Both the ```all_talk.py``` (```IPV4_UDP_Broadcaster``` class) ```all_listen.py``` (```IPV4_UDP_Receiver``` class) files include a main function that instantiates objects and then runs them in a simple test.

Just run broadcaster and receiver on one or more computers on the same network segment and see what happens.

### How to Run Broadcaster Portion of Test

 ```bash
 python3.11 all_talk.py
 ```

### How to Run Receiver Portion of Test

```bash
python3.11 all_listen.py
```
